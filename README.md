This branch is created for reproducing Solving Sudoku Puzzle algorithm developed by Peter Norvig: https://norvig.com/sudoku.html

This project will continue to be compeleted. The main ideal is to develop a program that can solve each suduko puzzle, and generate suduko puzzle automatically. The designing ideal please refere to the link of Peter Norvig, in later time a comment md file will be uploaded to show my own idea and designing solutions.
